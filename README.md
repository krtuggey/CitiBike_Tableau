# CitiBike_Tableau

#### Purpose
I have been giving a .csv file containing numerous bikesharing data. I can use this data, but first I need to convert the "tripduration" data into a format that I can use (datetime). Once I have successfully converted the .csv file, I can open it in Tableau and make some visualizations. Using the converted data, I intend to:
 - show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
 - show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
 - show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

#### Results
[Tableau visualizations can be found here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/katherine.tuggey "Tableau visualizations can be seen here")

Using tableau, I completed five total visualizations for the business analytics. These visuals are:
 - a line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users
 - a line graph displaying the number of bikes that are checked out by duration for each gender by the hour 
 - a heatmap showing the number of bike trips for each hour of each day of the week
 - a heatmap showing the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week
 - a heatmap showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
